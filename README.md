## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-11-25: Chain initialized
  * 2022-11-25: Proposal 1 goes into voting period
  * 2022-11-28: Proposal 1 voting period ends
  * 2022-11-28: Spawn time: `2022-11-28T14:00:00.000000Z`
  * 2022-11-29: The `goc-coordinator` validator will start signing on Duality at `2022-11-29T14:00:00.000000Z`.


Duality will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/blob/main/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md#consumer-chain-start-process) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary can be built by following the build instructions in the `duality` repo. The tag to build on is [v0.1.0](https://github.com/duality-labs/duality/tree/v0.1.0). You can generate the binary following the [build instructions](https://github.com/duality-labs/duality/blob/v0.1.0/readme.md).

  * [Linux amd64 build](dualityd)
  * SHA256: `ed0f6229eeccab9c9101e97b2577a2008ce34e00bc3ec734d78dce501c223840`

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Fresh genesis file **without CCV state**: **[genesis.json](genesis.json)**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **<will be specified after CCV state is generated by the provider chain>**
- SHA256: `4bb82a71d22f71e1bf5ffebc28e28f1986243418846663a2c16c1a5a60757d70`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `duality`
* Denom: `stake`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Two additional genesis accounts were added to provide funds for a faucet and a relayer that will be run by the testnet coordinators.
