## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-11-25: Chain initialized
  * 2022-11-25: Proposal 1 goes into voting period
  * 2022-11-28: Proposal 1 voting period ends
  * 2022-11-28: Spawn time: `2022-11-28T14:00:00.000000Z`


Duality will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/blob/main/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md#consumer-chain-start-process) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Downloading the binary

[Duality](https://github.com/duality-labs/duality) v0.1.0 binaries are [available for download](https://github.com/duality-labs/duality/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

### Building from source

Steps to build:
1. Install the [Ignite CLI](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/install): `curl https://get.ignite.com/cli@v0.25.2\! | bash`
2. Check out the duality repo at the release tag: `git clone -b v0.1.0 git@github.com:duality-labs/duality.git`
3. Build the binary: `cd duality && ignite chain build -t linux:amd64` (substituting your target os:arch)

The binary will be output to `$GOHOME/bin/dualityd`, with sha256 checksum `ed0f6229eeccab9c9101e97b2577a2008ce34e00bc3ec734d78dce501c223840`.

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Fresh genesis file **without CCV state**: **[genesis.json](genesis.json)**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **to be specified after CCV state is generated by the provider chain**
- SHA256: `4bb82a71d22f71e1bf5ffebc28e28f1986243418846663a2c16c1a5a60757d70`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `duality`
* Denom: `stake`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Two additional genesis accounts were added to provide funds for a faucet and a relayer that will be run by the testnet coordinators.

### Endpoints:

* **p2p seeds: `c6074d581d5a93fdf8e13a1a6da41a142189c1a9@tenderseed.ccvalidators.com:29069`**
* **p2p persistent-peers:**
